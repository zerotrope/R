SURVIVAL ANALYSIS

Duration data : measure usually time duration.
	- non negative
	- info partially recorded

The logrank test is non parametric. It assumes no specific distribution of the data, it does not
care in a sense.

17/10/2018 morning recap:
1 sample inference : KM, HF (survival::survfit)
2 samples comparison : logrank + weighted variations (survival::survdiff)

Cox Proportional hazard models (CPH)
Semi-parametric : beta is a parameter but yet we do not fully specify the distribution of the outcome.
To carry on estimation (classical approaches: MLE) here a partial likelihood is required because ti,
which has to be maximized to get the estimated beta.
The partial likelihood considers the time discrepencies in experience observations.
Conceptually partial likelihood = risk attached to an individual / sum risks attached to all individual
in sample.

hi(t) = h0(t).exp(xi.beta) 
with 
	xi = 1 as sleep deprived rats & xi = 0 as sleepful
	h0(t) = base risk, ok to ignore it

Sum-up on TESTS:
 - Logrank : comparing 2 groups, null hypothesis is "survival in group 1 equals survival in group 2" with
 no assumptions at all and you don't get any quantification of the magnitude of the significance of the test;
 - Stratified logrank test : as logrank, controlling for confounder (considering the effect of a covariate)
 thus more specific in conditionning the variables and their influence on each other;
 - Cox regression : compare 2+ groups, getting additionnally a ratio h1/h0 with the assumption that
 the risks associated with both groups are proportional: 
	- h1(t) = h0(t).lambda
	- h1(t)/h0(t) = exp(beta) (does not depend on t)
 you get the magnitude of the significance of the test with CPH.
 
Recap (slide 81)
Preliminary:
 - identify what you are working with: time data with right-censored data or other things.
When no censoring in data, MLE, logistic model, classic statistics method are ok.
With non-parametric right-censored data:
 - 1 sample: KM, HF
 - 2 samples: logrank, stratified logrank test
With continuous and/or multiple covariates, right-censored data:
 - coxph

Check:
 - linear predictors
 - right-censored data
 - KM, HF
 - estimators
