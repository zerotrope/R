SURVIVAL ANALYSIS

Duration data : measure usually time duration.
	- non negative
	- info partially recorded

Statistical consulting
	- Input file (Excel, Access... etc.) -> convert in csv text files & import to R.
	- Find issues with data (usually)
	
The logrank test is non parametric. It assumes no specific distribution of the data, it does not
care in a sense.

1 sample inference : KM, HF (survival::survfit)
2 samples comparison : logrank + weighted variations (survival::survdiff)

Cox Proportional hazard models (CPH)
Semi-parametric : beta is a parameter but yet we do not fully specify the distribution of the outcome.
To carry on estimation (classical approaches: MLE) here a partial likelihood is required because ti,
which has to be maximized to get the estimated beta.
The partial likelihood considers the time discrepencies in experience observations.
Conceptually partial likelihood = risk attached to an individual / sum risks attached to all individual
in sample.

hi(t) = h0(t).exp(xi.beta) 
with 
	xi = 1 as sleep deprived rats & xi = 0 as sleepful
	h0(t) = base risk, ok to ignore it

Sum-up on TESTS:
 - Logrank : comparing 2 groups, null hypothesis is "survival in group 1 equals survival in group 2" with
 no assumptions at all and you don't get any quantification of the magnitude of the significance of the test;
 - Stratified logrank test : as logrank, controlling for confounder (considering the effect of a covariate)
 thus more specific in conditionning the variables and their influence on each other;
 - Cox regression : compare 2+ groups, getting additionnally a ratio h1/h0 with the assumption that
 the risks associated with both groups are proportional: 
	- h1(t) = h0(t).lambda
	- h1(t)/h0(t) = exp(beta) (does not depend on t)
 you get the magnitude of the significance of the test with CPH.
 
Recap (slide 81)
Preliminary:
 - identify what you are working with: time data with right-censored data or other things.
When no censoring in data, MLE, logistic model, classic statistics method are ok.
With non-parametric right-censored data:
 - 1 sample: KM, HF
 - 2 samples: logrank, stratified logrank test
With continuous and/or multiple covariates, right-censored data:
 - coxph

plot Likelihood vs beta.
Difference between supl(beta) with beta in theta0 and supl(beta) with beta = theta
Thus 2.[supl(beta) in theta0 - supl(beta) in theta] = LRT
l(beta;y)
theta0 = null hypothesis subspace
LRTn ~ Chi²(1) with 1 degree of freedom
"to know the distribution of LRT, if you don't know their variance, you proceed to a t-test"

plot beta1(group) vs beta2(age)
so here theta = (beta1, beta2) in R² so THETA = R² (2 dimensions)
With H0 : "beta1 = beta2 = 0" then
 - THETA0 = {0, 0}
 - LRT ~ Chi²(2)
With H0 : "beta2 = 0" then
 - THETA0 = { beta2 = 0 } a line
 - LRT ~ Chi²(1)

 - Lirelihood Ratio Test for nested models
 - Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
 - Step function
 - Concordance index (performance metric)
 - Area Under the Curve (AUC)

- First
- Strata
- Diagnostics: what to do if hypothesis of proportionality of hazards does not hild? If it doesn't matter you ignore it otherwise
	- Cox stratification
	- truncation: cut the sample to simplify the observations and see if the differences significant or not (if they are due
to hazard or not).

Penalized regression
when lots of features (millions?) compared to sample size. We impose constraints on the beta, bounding it to
do not exceed some threshold c. This is due to the fact that when the number of features p > the number operations n, the beta 
that maximizes the MLE goes +inf. 
 - glmnet(x, y, fmily ="cox")
It allows to identify the "trajectories" of the betas.
Cross validation allows you to identify what threshold level should I settle.

Exercise:
Use Cox regression to assess if body temperature impacts time of hospitalization from hospitalization.csv

Check:
 - linear predictors
 - right-censored data
 - KM, HF
 - estimators
 - AIC
